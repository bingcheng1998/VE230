## About Honor Code

If there is same questions or labs in the future, it is the responsibility of JI students not to copy or modify these codes, or TeX files because it is against the Honor Code. The owner of this repository dosen't take any commitment for other's faults.

According to the student handbook (2015 version),

> It is a violation of the Honor Code for students to submit, as their own, work that is not the result of their own labor and thoughts. This applies, in particular, to ideas, expressions or work obtained from other students as well as from books, the internet, and other sources. The failure to properly credit ideas, expressions or work from others is considered plagiarism.

## Grading Policy: 

\- Ve230 offers a number of assignments which will not be graded but corrected in recitation classes

\- Final (30%)

 

Academic Integrity: (Any types of honor code regulations like class rules, homework policy, exam rules or project collaboration policy could be defined here) 

   Problem sets (homework assignments) may be done with partners, but I believe that you do not fully understand the technical material unless you work on enough problems by yourself. 

   Exams will be given under the JI’s Honor Code and will require individual efforts. The exams will be closed book. Scientific calculators can be used for the exams. The use of other electronic devices such as electronic dictionary and cell phone during exams will constitute an Honor Code violation. If you miss an exam, real documentation is required stating why you could not attend (severe disease, for example).

Course Objectives

To teach the fundamental principles in electromagnetism with a special emphasis on understanding rather than simply learning. The instructor will put a major focus on understanding the concepts sustaining such fundamental principles. 

The instructor will be carrying live questions (a kind of oral quiz) along with lectures. The objective is to initiate permanent exchanges and interactions with the students to improve the process of understanding.

The recitations classes conducted by the TA’s are of fundamental importance to complete the understanding of difficult concepts.  

Course description and detailed teaching schedules:
